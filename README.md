# FisheryConditionLinks

Fish condition, “fatness”, is an important driver of population productivity. Condition is affected by changing habitat (e.g. temperature) and ecosystem productivity, and in turn can affect market prices. We are investigating potential factors influencing fish condition to better inform operational fishery management decisions.

**Project Objective**   

Link indicators in the State of the Ecosystem report quantitatively to provide advice for fishery management. Determine drivers of changes in fish condition factor, role of primary production, and social and economic impacts (individual species and aggregate if possible), including changes in weight/price.

*Specific objectives*
- Condition factor as leading indicator for what goes on in the market (species level; how to link to fishing communities?)
- Environmental drivers of changing fish condition/productivity (aggregate level)
